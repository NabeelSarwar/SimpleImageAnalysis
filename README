Simple image analysis using Weka. By using the color differences in the images and normalizing them, we can use this data to classify incoming images.

The steps can be generalized to add filters and use other classifying algorithm. 

The two main classes are the ColorCollector and ClassifierMachine. The ClassifierMachine uses simple Bayesian classification now. It will use k-nearest neighbor in addition at some point in the future.
